Description by ClaudioDavi
Super Heroes Dataset Context Super Heroes have been in popular culture for a long time and now more than ever. Since its creation, super heroes have not been very diverse, but that is changing rapidly. This dataset aims to provide an overview about heroes and their physical as well as power characteristics, helping researchers and curious minds identify trends and patterns.

Content This data was collected in June/2017 from superherodb and not updated since, so it may not be up to date. There are two datasets here. The first one lists the characteristics of every super hero found on my source, the second contains information about every superpower and lists if they are present in any given hero.

Acknowledgements This data was scraped from SuperHeroDb https://www.superherodb.com/.

Inspiration What are the characteristics of your favorite super heroes?

Dataset:
heroes_information.csv(48.04 KB) -This file holds the demographics of each hero as well as which comic/studio they originate from.

super_hero_powers.csv(656.55 KB) - The format is Boolean. Each hero is listed under hero names and then each remain field has a TRUE/FALSE entry regarding if that hero has that power.

My objectives for this project are following:
practice with Pandas
data cleaning
visualization
providing insights
practice stats
